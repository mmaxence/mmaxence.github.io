      <description>&lt;p&gt;From January 2021, I took on a product Manager role for our supply business. I led a cross-functional team of 10 members and I was in charge of the performance of our supply products interfaces (for App/Web Publishers) until March 2022. This was the first second-degree management opportunity I&amp;rsquo;ve had as this team also counts one PM in charge of specific products. After a little more than one year of kicking off this mission team, we&amp;rsquo;ve recorded several KPI improvements, with most products refactored for greater interconnection, paving the way for further opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
