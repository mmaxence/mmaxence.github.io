Alongside my current role as Product Owner, I manage a very compact and efficient team of rockstar designers. Considering my resources, I focused on building a very agile and autonomous Design work process based on high-quality hirings and autonomous workflows. All Designers are performing Peer reviews to promote feedback while all of us belong to different mission teams.

#### New start, new challenges, new life

In Late 2014 I joined buzzvil as their lead designer, a dynamic startup based in Seoul. Six months later, we were releasing a new [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buzzvil.adhours&hl=en) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/%ED%97%88%EB%8B%88%EC%8A%A4%ED%81%AC%EB%A6%B0/id591658676) Honeyscreen App. This is the beginning of a long story during which I've already learned so much!

#### Work smarter, be lazier
Not long after joining I could identify the team's major pain points and start taking actions to solve them one by one.
Lots of work, particularly related to marketing and creative designs were heavily repetitive and inefficient. This marks a growing interest in <mark>Pattern recognition</mark> and the discovery of <mark>DesignOps</mark> to improve our work process.    

#### Feeling limited
A couple of years in, predicting heavier headcount growth, I've decided to invest more in becoming a better leader so that I could achieve more than I could do by myself. I've spent more of my resources learning to be a <mark>greater leader than being a better designer</mark>.    
It materialized in research and theory ([read:](/library/) [High Output Management from Andrew Grove](https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK)) and by consolidating a <mark>hiring strategy</mark> for the next few years.

#### Becoming a better manager.
<mark>Being an expert at what you are doing doesn't make you a great manager</mark>. With a team growing fast, It was time to put theory into practice. I've learned key lessons through hard experiences and great guidance from my managers. Getting to know the value of delegation, and communicating effectively. Simply becoming a better manager.

#### Opening Design to anyone
In 2019, We've internally published the first version of our Design system. <mark>From that moment on anyone in the company could access and <i>play Lego</i> with our components and layouts</mark>. Since then we've seen many teams using these assets to mockup their own things such as what a potential partner integration would look like. Alongside our Product release note, we now publically publish the related Design updates over ready-to-customize, prototype-ready design resources.

#### Design system expert
The team recently published an online version of our [Design System](https://design.buzzvil.com). ðŸŽŠ   
Building a Design system is more a story about team organization, workflow, and Principles than it is about Components.
