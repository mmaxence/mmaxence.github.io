Alongside my current role as Product Manager, I lead a very compact and efficient team of rockstar designers. Considering my resources, I focused on building a very agile and autonomous Design work process based on high-quality hirings and autonomous workflows. All Designers are performing Peer reviews to promote feedback while all of us belong to different mission teams.

#### Designer

No matter my title, I am and always will be a Designer. This is in my DNA, and it affects everything I do (at work just like at home). I have a true passion for Design methods and I always do my best to advocate them inside or outside my company.

#### Design leadership

Design teams like any other specialty, require adequate guidance. From a function-led organization to a cross-functional one, my leadership had to evolve a lot during all these years. Despite my other responsibilities inside the company, I always took pride in leading this amazing Design team, making sure that the methods, tools, and technics all designers use are the most adequate for the job. The most important aspect of this job today is about hiring and coaching designers and acting as a supporter.

#### Hiring expertise

Over all these years, I had the amazing opportunity to interview dozens of talented designers. Hire and coach a few of them. I spent hours learning, trying, and building recruiting strategies and expertise. In a competitive environment like Seoul, I had to be on top of all the latest technics to recruit talents. In the process, I also got close to our recruiting team, to better collaborate.

#### Design Systems

With an intent to achieve more with what we have, I initiated the creation of what composes and rules 100% of our Product & Brand design outcomes: [Design Systems](https://design.buzzvil.com).
These include UI libraries, but also Design principles, methods, and much more. All Designers are permanently participating in making this system evolve. We've set workflows and peer reviews to secure its quality so that anyone inside the design team or outside can use it with the most up-to-date assets.
A couple of years ago, we also released a light version of this system on Figma Community.
