From January 2021, I took on a product leader role for our supply business. I lead a cross-disciplinary team of 10 members and I am in charge of the performances of our supply products interfaces (for App/Web Publishers). This is the first second degree management opportunity I've had as this team also counts one PM in charge of specific products. These new responsibilities came with a company-wide move to be more performance-oriented as well as customer-obsessed. A great way for me to strengthen my business understanding and grow my management skills. I intentionally moved further away from product Design to better understand how product business works. In my quest to become a better product people and leader, I found Design methods to be extremely powerful tools, notably in this quest of being more customer-obsessed!
