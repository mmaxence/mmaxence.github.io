From January 2021, I took on a product Manager role for our supply business. I led a cross-functional team of 10 members and I was in charge of the performance of our supply products interfaces (for App/Web Publishers) until March 2022. This was the first second-degree management opportunity I've had as this team also counts one PM in charge of specific products. After a little more than one year of kicking off this mission team, we've recorded several KPI improvements, with most products refactored for greater interconnection, paving the way for further opportunities.

In April 2022, I started an entirely new mission team that acts as a startup inside the startup. This new mission will define our next monetization products, to grow our customer reach. Setting up a new vision and product strategy, hiring the team, and going through product discovery are the tasks I am currently busy with lately!
