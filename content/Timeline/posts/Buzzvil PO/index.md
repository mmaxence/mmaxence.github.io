From January 2021, I took on a Product Owner role for our supply business. I lead a cross-disciplinary team of 10 members and I am in charge of the performances of our supply products interfaces (for App/Web Publishers). These new responsibilities came with a company-wide will to be more performance-oriented as well as customer-obsessed. A great way for me to strengthen my business understanding and grow my management skills. I intentionally moved further away from product Design to better understand how product business works. In my quest to becoming a better product owner, I found Design methods to be extremely powerful tools.
