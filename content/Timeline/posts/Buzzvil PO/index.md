Since 2018 I've been facilitating amazing mission teams. The first mission was about giving the company a strong focus on improving our overall customer experience. This was a cross-disciplinary team and it happened right after our company moved to a matrix organization, adjusting our structure to accommodate the many newcomers and be more scalable.
Followed a couple of other close-ended missions I had the chance to initiate and complete, until late 2020.
These were priceless experiences that nurtured a strong interest in product growth, expanding the reach beyond product Design only. Life lessons really, learning through hit-and-miss experiences. Amazing opportunities to rinse & repeat my leadership and management processes throughout multiple, short experiences.
