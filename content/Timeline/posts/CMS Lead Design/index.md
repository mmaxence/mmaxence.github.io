CMS group (previously 3S Informatique) offered me my first long projects. I spent more than 3 years working in research labs. I could adjust the methods I learned at school, learn how to interact inside a development team, and publish my very first research paper in Tokyo.

#### The real test
I started working for a Research Lab incubated by CMS Group, an IT consulting company based in Paris. Most of my work in the first year happened to be in the Arts & Metiers campus, closely working with a team of researchers to shape the concept of what will keep me busy for the next 3 years. My workplace changed to CMS Group (formerly 3S) Product team after the research, identification, and ideation phases of the design thinking process were done. This same year the team got founded by the E.U. as a research project.

#### Interest in coding to better design
I've learned a lot while closely working with a team of engineers from the early stages of our product to the alpha version. I've learned from mistakes, iterating fast. I built my first UI system based on Bootstrap. With this live UI library, I could control the entire appearance of our LMS throughout these CSS/JS-based style guides and layouts. This decision was based on the many headaches I encountered to hand off my Design to developers (There were no Figma or Zeplin at that time!)

#### When Design meets Research
Because outcomes were worth sharing, I co-published a paper called "The CO-SI Card method: how to refine and validate concepts through a scenario generator framework" at [IASDR](https://iasdr.net/) Tokyo about co-design with C√©dric Mivielle.
Around 2013 the project moved to the alpha version. I've been allowed to assist and collaborate with the Randstad training team to test the platform in real conditions. From that point, our product got decoupled in different variations based on that same tech, with different purposes.

#### Time to wrap up, communicate on achievements & move on!
I've introduced my experience as an Interaction design Alumnus during some [open days](https://www.lecolededesign.com/actualites/portes-ouvertes-2014-conferences-et-temoignages-d-anciens-1771) at my former school l'√©cole de design de Nantes Atlantique.

I've participated in a European Campus which was about UX Design and learning services organized by the University of Poitiers. 
I lectured about being a [UX designer working on a professional training platform](https://uptv.univ-poitiers.fr/program/campus-europeen-d-ete-201s3etnbsp-ux-designetnbsp-l-experience-utilisateur-au-service-des-apprentissagesetnbsp/video/3890/vue-etquot-votre-universite-d-entreprise-etquot-de-la-conception-de-methodes-a-la-conception-d-un-service/index.html) as well as being a UX designer part of a [panel of UX professionals (video in French)](https://uptv.univ-poitiers.fr/program/campus-europeen-d-ete-2013etnbsp-ux-designetnbsp-l-experience-utilisateur-au-service-des-apprentissagesetnbsp/video/3897/ux-designer-metier-ou-phenomene-de-mode-l-avis-des-professionnels/index.html).

After recruiting and onboarding another Designer to replace me, I've finally decided to end my journey in this Lab and Paris to move to Seoul! ‚úàÔ∏è üá∞üá∑

Later this year I participated in an amazing workshop at KAIST, regrouping artists and designers from all over the world, engineers from the KAIST campus, and kids from local schools to be imagining Daejeon city in 2050.
