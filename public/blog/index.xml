Mornings start with spilled milk; evenings end with unread messages. Somewhere between product reviews and bedtime stories, things blur together: noise, laughter, Slack, Lego. It&amp;rsquo;s not balance, but a kind of rhythm. Imperfect, fast, sometimes ridiculous, and strangely, it works. But how?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beyond the Horizon: A Journey Through the Evolution of AI Interaction</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/beyond-the-horizon-a-journey-through-the-evolution-of-ai-interaction/report_adapted_updated/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/beyond-the-horizon-a-journey-through-the-evolution-of-ai-interaction/report_adapted_updated/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-brief-step-back">A brief step back&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last decade I‚Äôve seen design evolve from being a discipline stuck on its own to one that truly supports business goals. When I started my career, I was the only designer on projects and had to build my own methodologies from scratch. That taught me the value of simplifying complex ideas, using numbers to back decisions, and building reusable systems so that your team isn‚Äôt reinventing the wheel every time. Those same lessons apply to the current hype around AI.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>High output management: identifying and measuring your design outputs</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/high_output_management/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/high_output_management/</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="design-oriented-takeaways-from-andrew-groves-best-seller">Design oriented Takeaways from Andrew Grove‚Äôs best seller.&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>My CEO strongly recommended me to read ‚Äú&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324750.High_Output_Management">High output management&lt;/a>‚Äù a while ago as my team was growing and my management responsibilities accentuated. It eventually gave me some of the most valuable insights for me to grow as a manager. This article analyses and translates my personal experiences, describing how I translated Grove‚Äôs inputs into my Design lead routine. But first I‚Äôd like to start with a short back story to understand where I come from.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tools to build a design system in 2020</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/tools_to_build_a_design_system_in_2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/tools_to_build_a_design_system_in_2020/</guid><description>&lt;p>A snap taken during our last sprint prior to publish our system online&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a healthy, yearly routine I genuinely recommend to follow regardless of the size of your team: gauging your current toolbox against what‚Äôs new in the busy design tool industry. We are a team of 6 designers (3 visual &amp;amp; 3 product designers). We conducted our research and tests with a focus on design systems. You‚Äôll find tons of other articles about this, we‚Äôve read them all (or close) and now posting our share to the chain :).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design Tempo: the art of managing creative pace</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/design_tempo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 08:10:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/design_tempo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Designers, like musicians, need to play in diapason in order to come up with melodious experiences. üé∂&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a subjective essay, a short read about &lt;strong>Creative team pace management&lt;/strong>. It is based on experience, discussions with peers over the years, personal thoughts &amp;amp; analysis.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design criticism</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/design_criticism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jan 2020 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/design_criticism/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="how-to-avoid-friction-when-receiving-feedback-on-your-design">How to avoid friction when receiving feedback on your design.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It usually starts like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I don‚Äôt like the blue here, can you please change to something more&amp;hellip; red-ish?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is generally enough for a designer‚Äôs face to turn.. üò° &lt;em>red-ish&lt;/em> and internally blame the poor bastard‚Äôs parents for bringing him to this world. Probably also questioning why someone with such poor fashion taste would even dare question his or her Design choices..&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Study*(Designers+Engineers)= ‚ù§Ô∏è pt.2</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/studydesigners+engineers-%EF%B8%8F-pt2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/studydesigners+engineers-%EF%B8%8F-pt2/</guid><description>&lt;p>We‚Äôve shared a &lt;a href="https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/studydesigners+engineers-%EF%B8%8F-pt1/">first story&lt;/a> about how we started a study between engineers and designers.

It was an insightful and fun experience. Fun enough to run 2 different projects summarized over 2 different stories. Here is the first one, sharing both designer and engineer points of views.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design system at Buzzvil</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/design-system-at-buzzvil/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 May 2019 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/design-system-at-buzzvil/</guid><description>&lt;p>Design system vs startup. Takeaways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We built a Design system. It took us time, resources and a lot of energy, involving pretty much everyone in our design team. And it‚Äôs just the beginning of a long story. If you are working at a startup and are considering building a design system, you might find clues reading about our experience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design peer reviews to support our team growth</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/design-peer-reviews-to-support-our-team-growth/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2019 11:31:33 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/design-peer-reviews-to-support-our-team-growth/</guid><description>&lt;p>I always hope to see my teammates collaborate more.
