Mornings start with spilled milk; evenings end with unread messages. Somewhere between product reviews and bedtime stories, things blur together: noise, laughter, Slack, Lego. It&amp;rsquo;s not balance, but a kind of rhythm. Imperfect, fast, sometimes ridiculous, and strangely, it works. But how?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beyond the Horizon: A Journey Through the Evolution of AI Interaction</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/beyond-the-horizon-a-journey-through-the-evolution-of-ai-interaction/report_adapted_updated/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jul 2025 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/beyond-the-horizon-a-journey-through-the-evolution-of-ai-interaction/report_adapted_updated/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-brief-step-back">A brief step back&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Over the last decade I’ve seen design evolve from being a discipline stuck on its own to one that truly supports business goals. When I started my career, I was the only designer on projects and had to build my own methodologies from scratch. That taught me the value of simplifying complex ideas, using numbers to back decisions, and building reusable systems so that your team isn’t reinventing the wheel every time. Those same lessons apply to the current hype around AI.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chief Design Officer @buzzvil</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/timeline/posts/cdo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Sep 2022 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/timeline/posts/cdo/</guid><description>&lt;p>It was time to take a step back from product management and put a stronger focus on Design, as the team grew in numbers and our business now needs to better control our design outcomes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Product Manager @buzzvil</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/timeline/posts/buzzvil-pm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 15:47:02 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/timeline/posts/buzzvil-pm/</guid><description>&lt;p>From January 2021, I took on a product Manager role for our supply business. I led a cross-functional team of 10 members and I was in charge of the performance of our supply products interfaces (for App/Web Publishers) until March 2022. This was the first second-degree management opportunity I&amp;rsquo;ve had as this team also counts one PM in charge of specific products. After a little more than one year of kicking off this mission team, we&amp;rsquo;ve recorded several KPI improvements, with most products refactored for greater interconnection, paving the way for further opportunities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>High output management: identifying and measuring your design outputs</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/high_output_management/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/high_output_management/</guid><description>&lt;h4 id="design-oriented-takeaways-from-andrew-groves-best-seller">Design oriented Takeaways from Andrew Grove’s best seller.&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>My CEO strongly recommended me to read “&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/324750.High_Output_Management">High output management&lt;/a>” a while ago as my team was growing and my management responsibilities accentuated. It eventually gave me some of the most valuable insights for me to grow as a manager. This article analyses and translates my personal experiences, describing how I translated Grove’s inputs into my Design lead routine. But first I’d like to start with a short back story to understand where I come from.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tools to build a design system in 2020</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/tools_to_build_a_design_system_in_2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/tools_to_build_a_design_system_in_2020/</guid><description>&lt;p>A snap taken during our last sprint prior to publish our system online&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a healthy, yearly routine I genuinely recommend to follow regardless of the size of your team: gauging your current toolbox against what’s new in the busy design tool industry. We are a team of 6 designers (3 visual &amp;amp; 3 product designers). We conducted our research and tests with a focus on design systems. You’ll find tons of other articles about this, we’ve read them all (or close) and now posting our share to the chain :).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design Tempo: the art of managing creative pace</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/design_tempo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 08:10:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/design_tempo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Designers, like musicians, need to play in diapason in order to come up with melodious experiences. 🎶&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It usually starts like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I don’t like the blue here, can you please change to something more&amp;hellip; red-ish?&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is generally enough for a designer’s face to turn.. 😡 &lt;em>red-ish&lt;/em> and internally blame the poor bastard’s parents for bringing him to this world. Probably also questioning why someone with such poor fashion taste would even dare question his or her Design choices..&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Study*(Designers+Engineers)= ❤️ pt.2</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/studydesigners+engineers-%EF%B8%8F-pt2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/studydesigners+engineers-%EF%B8%8F-pt2/</guid><description>&lt;p>We’ve shared a &lt;a href="https://mmaxence.me/blog/posts/studydesigners+engineers-%EF%B8%8F-pt1/">first story&lt;/a> about how we started a study between engineers and designers.

The first mission was about giving the company a strong focus on improving our overall customer experience. This was a cross-disciplinary team and it happened right after our company moved to a matrix organization, adjusting our structure to accommodate the many newcomers and be more scalable.
Followed a couple of other close-ended missions I had the chance to initiate and complete, until late 2020.
These were priceless experiences that nurtured a strong interest in product growth, expanding the reach beyond product Design only. Life lessons really, learning through hit-and-miss experiences. Amazing opportunities to rinse &amp;amp; repeat my leadership and management processes throughout multiple, short experiences.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Head of Design @buzzvil</title><link>https://mmaxence.me/timeline/posts/buzzvil-head-of-design/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2014 11:07:21 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://mmaxence.me/timeline/posts/buzzvil-head-of-design/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alongside my current role as Product Manager, I lead a very compact and efficient team of rockstar designers.
