<h5 id="seoul-2014-to-present">Seoul - 2014 to present</h5>

<h2 id="2014-2015">2014 / 2015</h2>

<h3 id="new-start-new-challenges-new-life">New start, new challenges, new life</h3>

<p>Late 2014 I joined buzzvil as lead designer, a promising startup based in Seoul. In June I was releasing my first Android and iOS Honeyscreen App with buzzvil. By the second semester the team was releasing buzzscreen SDK for partners to be using the same technology over their own service. This is the beginning of a long story where I&rsquo;ve already learnt so much!</p>

<h2 id="2016">2016</h2>

<h3 id="work-smarter-be-lazier">Work smarter, be lazier</h3>

<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself as lazy per se, but I do enjoy a lot finding solutions to shorten boring, repetitive work. This marks the beginning of my interest for <mark>Pattern recognition</mark> and the discovery of <mark>DesignOps</mark>.</p>

<h2 id="2017">2017</h2>

<h3 id="feeling-limited-by-my-own-capabilities">Feeling limited by my own capabilities</h3>

<p>That year is important in my career. This is the time I&rsquo;ve decided to invest in becoming a better leader in order to achieve more than I could do just by myself. <mark>I&rsquo;ve started investing more time being a greater leader than being a better designer</mark>.</p>

<h2 id="2018">2018</h2>

<h3 id="the-year-i-became-a-better-manager">The year I became a better manager.</h3>

<p><mark>Being an expert at what you are doing doesn&rsquo;t make you a great manager</mark>. During this year and with the team growing up, I&rsquo;ve learnt a few things on how to become a better manager. I&rsquo;ve learnt through theory (<a href="/shelf/">shelf:</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK">High Output Management from Andrew Grove</a>) but also through hard experiences and great guidance from my managers.</p>

<h3 id="opening-design-to-non-designers">Opening Design to non-designers</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ve published internally the first version of our Design system. <mark>From now on anyone in the company can access and play Lego with these components and layout</mark>. Since then we&rsquo;ve seen various team using these assets to mockup what would look like a potential partner integration over our While Label SDK. Designers are asked to help out if requested but our time can now focus on actual design for our upcoming releases!</p>

<h2 id="2019">2019</h2>

<h3 id="design-system-expert">Design system expert</h3>

<p>The team is about to publish an online version of our Design System. 🎊<br />
Building a Design system is more a story about team organization, workflow and Principles than it is about Components.</p>

<h3 id="leading-a-mission-team">Leading a mission team</h3>

<p>Later last year I started leading an amazing mission team called UXP (User eXPerience) with goal to enhance our usability and test new features. The team consisted of 2 designers, 3 client engineers, 1 server engineer and a PM. For many of us it was the first time closely working with different fields and we learnt a lot from this experience. We&rsquo;ve made mistakes that makes us all today much stronger than we were. The mission eventually ended up last July and merged with another team to help us move our inventory through our new vision. I now co-lead this inventory Lab team.</p>

<h5 id="paris-2011-to-2014">Paris - 2011 to 2014</h5>

<h2 id="2011">2011</h2>

<h3 id="the-real-test">The real test</h3>

<p>After taking 2 months break in Korea after my graduation, I started working for a Research Lab incubated by CMS Group, an IT consulting company based in Paris. Most of my work this year happened to be in Arts &amp; Metiers campus, closely working with a team of researchers to shape the concept of what will keep me busy for the next 3 years. My workplace changed to CMS Group Product team after the research, identification and ideation phases of the design thinking process were done. This year the project got founded by the E.U. as a research project.</p>

<h2 id="2012">2012</h2>

<h3 id="an-interest-for-coding-to-better-design">An interest for coding to better design</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learnt a lot during this year, closely working with a team of engineers from the early stages of our product to alpha version. I did a lot of mistakes but also learnt to iterate fast to allow myself failing on the way. I built my first UI system based on Bootstrap. I could control the entire appearance of our LMS throughout these CSS/JS based style guides and layouts. This decision was based on the many headaches I encountered to hand-off my Design to developers.</p>

<h2 id="2013">2013</h2>

<h3 id="when-design-meets-research">When Design meets Research</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve co-published a paper called &ldquo;&ldquo;The CO-SI Card method : how to refine and validate concepts through a scenario generator framework&rdquo; &ldquo; at <a href="https://iasdr.net/">IASDR</a> Tokyo about co-design with Cédric Mivielle.
That same year our project moved to Alpha version, I&rsquo;ve been given the opportunity to assist and collaborate with Randstad training team to test the platform in real conditions.</p>

<h2 id="2014">2014</h2>

<h3 id="time-to-wrap-up-communicate-on-achievements-move-on">Time to wrap up, communicate on achievements &amp; move on!</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve introduced my experience as an Interaction design Alumni during this year&rsquo;s open days at my former school l&rsquo;école de design de Nantes Atlantique.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&rsquo;ve participated to an European Campus which was about UX Design and learning services organized by the University of Poitiers. I lectured about being a UX designer working on an educational project and could introduce our project over 2 sessions.</p>

<hr />

<p>After recruiting and on-boarding another Designer to replace me, I&rsquo;ve finally decided to end my journey in this Lab and in Paris to relocate myself in Seoul! ✈️ 🇰🇷</p>

<hr />

<p>Later this year I&rsquo;ve participated to an amazing workshop in KAIST, regrouping artists and designers from all over the world, engineers from KAIST campus and kid from local school to be imagining the Daejeon city in 2050.</p>

<h1 id="freelance-school">Freelance &amp; School</h1>

<h5 id="nantes-laval-paris-2005-to-2010">Nantes / Laval / Paris - 2005 to 2010</h5>

<h2 id="2010">2010</h2>

<h3 id="head-full-of-dreams-and-a-true-passion-for-design">Head full of dreams and a true passion for Design</h3>

<p>I graduated from the excellent <a href="https://wwww.lecolededesign.com">L&rsquo;École de design Nantes Atlantique</a> - Master in Interaction Design with Honors.
I graduated from <a href="https://artsetmetiers.fr/en">L&rsquo;École Normale Supérieure des Arts et Metiers</a> - Research Master in Virtual Reality &amp; Innovation with honors.</p>

<hr />

<p>I also got an amazing last year&rsquo;s internship at a parisian startup called Domolib&rsquo;, creating home automation systems. In 6 months I could see my very first iPad application being published with positive reviews. It was about cooking recipes, the twist being that you could navigate through the steps without having to touch the screen as the App could detect a clap-clap as an indicator to move to the next step.</p>

<h2 id="before-2010">Before 2010</h2>

<h3 id="freelancer-first-client-interactions-first-responsibilities">Freelancer, first client interactions, first responsibilities!</h3>

<p>During my years of school I created my own company to freelance on a few projects. Mostly Website making and brand design. I&rsquo;ve learnt the importance of communication and how difficult this can be as part of a Design project with direct client interactions. It helped me become more aware of what surrounds a designer&rsquo;s job and understand in surface development constraints.</p>
