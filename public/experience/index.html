          <p>I recently took on a Product Owner role for our supply business. I handle a cross-disciplinary team of 8 members and I am in charge of the performances of our supply products (for App/Web Publishers). These new responsibilities came after a company-wide restructuring, aiming at being more performance-oriented as well as customer-obsessed. A great way for me to strengthen my business understanding and grow my management skills. I intentionally moved further away from product Design to better understand how product business works. In my quest to becoming a better product owner, I found Design methods to be extremely powerful tools.</p>

          <p>Since 2018 I&rsquo;ve been leading amazing mission teams. The first mission was about giving the company a strong focus on improving our overall customer experience. This was a cross-disciplinary team and it happened right after our company moved to a matrix organization, adjusting our structure to accommodate the many newcomers and be more scalable.
After that mission ended we merged with another mission to regroup and simplify our inventory and I took the lead to ease the transition.
In 2019 I&rsquo;ve joined a new project with a few members. This project called Nucleus nurtured and started to show promising results. I took the mission&rsquo;s lead at this time and accompanied the project until completion.
Finally, I could initiate another new mission with a short-term goal. That happened right before our next company reorgnization that would lead me to become Product Owner.</p>

<p>In Late 2014 I joined buzzvil as the lead designer, a dynamic startup based in Seoul. In June I was releasing my first <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buzzvil.adhours&amp;hl=en">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/kr/app/%ED%97%88%EB%8B%88%EC%8A%A4%ED%81%AC%EB%A6%B0/id591658676">iOS</a> Honeyscreen App with buzzvil. This is the beginning of a long story during which I&rsquo;ve already learned so much!</p>
<h4 id="work-smarter-be-lazier">Work smarter, be lazier</h4>
<p>I don&rsquo;t consider myself lazy per se, but I do enjoy a lot finding solutions to shorten boring, repetitive work. This marks a growing interest in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pattern recognition<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the discovery of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->DesignOps<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<h4 id="feeling-limited">Feeling limited</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to invest more in becoming a better leader so that I could achieve more than I could do by myself. I&rsquo;ve spent more of my resources learning to be a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->greater leader than being a better designer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <br>
It materialized in research and theory (<a href="/library/">read:</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Output-Management-Andrew-Grove-ebook/dp/B015VACHOK">High Output Management from Andrew Grove</a>) and by consolidating a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hiring strategy<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for the next few years.</p>
<h4 id="becoming-a-better-manager">Becoming a better manager.</h4>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I said, being an expert at what you are doing doesn&rsquo;t make you a great manager<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. With a team growing, It was time to put theory into practice. I&rsquo;ve learned key lessons through hard experiences and great guidance from my managers. Getting to know the value of delegation, and communicating effectively, simply becoming a better manager.</p>
<h4 id="opening-design-to-anyone">Opening Design to anyone</h4>
<p>In 2019, We&rsquo;ve internally published the first version of our Design system. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->From that moment on anyone in the company could access and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->play Lego<!-- raw HTML omitted --> with our components and layouts<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Since then we&rsquo;ve seen many teams using these assets to mockup their own things such as what a potential partner integration would look like. Alongside our Product release note, we now publically publish the related Design updates over ready-to-customize, prototype ready design resources.</p>
<h4 id="design-system-expert">Design system expert</h4>
<p>The team recently published an online version of our <a href="https://design.buzzvil.com">Design System</a>. 🎊<br>
Building a Design system is more a story about team organization, workflow, and Principles than it is about Components.</p>

            UX Design Lead @CMS Group
        </h1>

          Paris - 2011 to 2014
        </p>
        <div class="nested-links f4 lora lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
          <p>CMS group (previously 3S Informatique) offered me my first long projects. I spent more than 3 years working on research-oriented projects. I could adjust the methods I learned at school, learn how to interact inside a development team, and publish my very first research paper in Tokyo.</p>
<h4 id="the-real-test">The real test</h4>
<p>After taking 2 months break in Korea following my graduation, I started working for a Research Lab incubated by CMS Group, an IT consulting company based in Paris. Most of my work in the first year happened to be in the Arts &amp; Metiers campus, closely working with a team of researchers to shape the concept of what will keep me busy for the next 3 years. My workplace changed to CMS Group (formerly 3S) Product team after the research, identification, and ideation phases of the design thinking process were done. This same year the project got founded by the E.U. as a research project.</p>
<h4 id="interest-in-coding-to-better-design">Interest in coding to better design</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve learned a lot while closely working with a team of engineers from the early stages of our product to the alpha version. I&rsquo;ve learned from mistakes, iterating fast. I built my first UI system based on Bootstrap. With this live UI library, I could control the entire appearance of our LMS throughout these CSS/JS-based style guides and layouts. This decision was based on the many headaches I encountered to hand off my Design to developers.</p>
<h4 id="when-design-meets-research">When Design meets Research</h4>
<p>Because outcomes were worth sharing, I&rsquo;ve co-published a paper called &ldquo;&ldquo;The CO-SI Card method: how to refine and validate concepts through a scenario generator framework&rdquo; &quot; at <a href="https://iasdr.net/">IASDR</a> Tokyo about co-design with Cédric Mivielle.
Around 2013 the project moved to the alpha version. I&rsquo;ve been allowed to assist and collaborate with the Randstad training team to test the platform in real conditions. From that point, our product got decoupled in different variations based on that same tech, with different purposes.</p>
<h4 id="time-to-wrap-up-communicate-on-achievements--move-on">Time to wrap up, communicate on achievements &amp; move on!</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;ve introduced my experience as an Interaction design Alumni during some <a href="https://www.lecolededesign.com/actualites/portes-ouvertes-2014-conferences-et-temoignages-d-anciens-1771">open days</a> at my former school l&rsquo;école de design de Nantes Atlantique.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve participated in a European Campus which was about UX Design and learning services organized by the University of Poitiers.
I lectured about being a <a href="https://uptv.univ-poitiers.fr/program/campus-europeen-d-ete-201s3etnbsp-ux-designetnbsp-l-experience-utilisateur-au-service-des-apprentissagesetnbsp/video/3890/vue-etquot-votre-universite-d-entreprise-etquot-de-la-conception-de-methodes-a-la-conception-d-un-service/index.html">UX designer working on a professional training platform</a> as well as being a UX designer part of a <a href="https://uptv.univ-poitiers.fr/program/campus-europeen-d-ete-2013etnbsp-ux-designetnbsp-l-experience-utilisateur-au-service-des-apprentissagesetnbsp/video/3897/ux-designer-metier-ou-phenomene-de-mode-l-avis-des-professionnels/index.html">panel of UX professionals (video in French)</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>After recruiting and onboarding another Designer to replace me, I&rsquo;ve finally decided to end my journey in this Lab and in Paris to relocate myself to Seoul! ✈️ 🇰🇷</p>
<hr>
<p>Later this year I&rsquo;ve participated in an amazing workshop in KAIST, regrouping artists and designers from all over the world, engineer from the KAIST campus, and kids from local schools to be imagining the Daejeon city in 2050.</p>

<hr>
<p>I got an amazing last year&rsquo;s internship at a Parisian startup called Domolib', creating home automation systems. In 6 months I could see my very first iPad application being published with positive reviews. It was about a cooking app, the twist being that you could navigate through the steps without having to touch the screen as the App could detect a clap-clap as an indicator to move to the next step.</p>
<h3 id="freelancer-first-client-interactions-first-responsibilities">Freelancer, first client interactions, first responsibilities!</h3>
<p>During my school years, I created my own company to freelance on a few projects. Mostly about Website and brand design. I&rsquo;ve learned the importance of communication and how difficult this can be as part of a Design project with direct client interactions. It helped me become more aware of what surrounds a designer&rsquo;s job and understand in surface the development constraints.</p>
